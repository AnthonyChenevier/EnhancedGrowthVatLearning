    <vatGrowthPointMultiplier_Tooltip>Multiplier used to modify the final growth points given to vat occupants based on their learning need. Default value provides enough growth points to reach level 5 at each growth moment if they are kept in the vat the entire time</vatGrowthPointMultiplier_Tooltip>

    <learningNeedVariance_SettingsLabel>Learning need random variance</learningNeedVariance_SettingsLabel>
    <learningNeedVariance_Tooltip>Learning need fluctuates by a random percentage at a number of points during the day, to simulate the occupant doing different things within the simulation. The final learning need for the occupant is calculated as (base learning need for mode *  +/- random value up to this amount)</learningNeedVariance_Tooltip>

    <learningNeedDailyChangeRate_SettingsLabel>Learning need change rate</learningNeedDailyChangeRate_SettingsLabel>
    <learningNeedDailyChangeRate_Tooltip>How many times a day to recalculate the learning need for vat occupants in enhanced learning mode.</learningNeedDailyChangeRate_Tooltip>

    <vatLearningHediffSeverityPerDay_SettingsLabel>Enhanced skill Learning speed</vatLearningHediffSeverityPerDay_SettingsLabel>
    <vatLearningHediffSeverityPerDay_Tooltip>The rate at which the 'Enhanced Vat Learning' hediff advances. When 'Enhanced Vat Learning' hits 100%, the vat occupant receives an amount XP in a random skill, both selected by the learning mode. Change this to modify how often vat occupants get that boost. Higher values means more skills gained.</vatLearningHediffSeverityPerDay_Tooltip>

    <vatAgingFactor_SettingsLabel>Enhanced mode aging factor</vatAgingFactor_SettingsLabel>
    <vatAgingFactor_Tooltip>The multiplier for how fast vat occupants grow in enhanced learning mode. Vanilla vat occupants grow at a rate of 20x normal, this should be lower to provide a balance to the enhanced learning mode, and provide more time to accumulate growth points.</vatAgingFactor_Tooltip>

    <leaderAgingFactorModifier_SettingsLabel>Leader mode aging factor modifier</leaderAgingFactorModifier_SettingsLabel>
    <leaderAgingFactorModifier_Tooltip>Leader learning mode reduces aging factor by this amount, so that leaders have more time to mature and gain more skills and growth points.</leaderAgingFactorModifier_Tooltip>

    <LearningModes_Default>Default</LearningModes_Default>
    <DefaultMode_Desc>The default training suite is configured to provide a fairly unstructured learning environment in a common urbworld school. Vat occupants can gain random skills available at their age and enough growth is simulated to achieve growth tier 4-6 at each growth moment.</DefaultMode_Desc>

    <LearningModes_Combat>Combat</LearningModes_Combat>
    <CombatMode_Desc>The combat training suite is configured to provide a heavily structured learning environment in an urbworld military cadet school. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of combat and combat-related operations such as building defenses, breaching entrenched positions and triage. As more focus is put on certain skills being trained vat occupants have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.</CombatMode_Desc>

    <LearningModes_Labor>Labor</LearningModes_Labor>
    <LaborMode_Desc>The labor training suite is configured to provide a heavily structured learning environment on an off-grid agriworld homestead. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of farming, animal husbandry, housekeeping and maker skills. As occupants experience a harder, more work-oriented life they have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.</LaborMode_Desc>

    <LearningModes_Leader>Leader</LearningModes_Leader>
    <LeaderMode_Desc>The leadership training suite is configured to provide a lightly structured learning environment in a glitterworld private academy. Vat occupants gain more knowledge of the arts, medicine, trading, science and general leadership qualities. As the vat occupant experiences a very high resolution facsimile of life they are able to achieve even higher growth tiers of 5-7. Note that this mode runs at a higher resolution and requires more of the growth vat's available processing power, slowing down the growth of the occupant even further than other enhanced modes. NOTE: as intellectual work is disabled for children under 13 it is recommended to keep vat grown leaders in a vat until they are 18 so that they have any chance at all to study this skill.</LeaderMode_Desc>
