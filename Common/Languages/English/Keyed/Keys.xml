    <learningNeedVariance_SettingsLabel>Learning need max variance</learningNeedVariance_SettingsLabel>
    <learningNeedVariance_Tooltip>The learning need of enhanced vat occupants can vary by a random amount up to this value a set number of times per day. This simulates the occupants doing different tasks or doing very well or badly with their studies.\n\nA higher value here can cause much more variation in the Growth Tier achieved at each growth moment.</learningNeedVariance_Tooltip>

    <learningNeedDailyChangeRate_SettingsLabel>Learning need change rate</learningNeedDailyChangeRate_SettingsLabel>
    <learningNeedDailyChangeRate_Tooltip>How many times a day to recalculate the learning need for enhanced vat occupants. This can be used to balance the variance rate to make the results more or less predictable over time.</learningNeedDailyChangeRate_Tooltip>

    <vatDaysForBackstory_Tooltip>The number of *simulated* days a child must be in a growth vat in total before it tries to generate a mode-specific backstory when they reach their last growth moment.\n\The default value of 400 days matches the vanilla 'vatgrown child' backstory requirement and is just over half of the maximum amount of time an occupant could spend in the vat before that point (780 days or 13 RW years).</vatDaysForBackstory_Tooltip>

    <CurrentMode_Label>Currently configured for the '{0}' learning suite.</CurrentMode_Label>
    <DefaultMode_Desc>The default suite is configured to provide a fairly unstructured learning environment in a common urbworld school. Vat occupants can gain random skills available at their age and enough growth is simulated to achieve growth tier 4-6 at each growth moment.</DefaultMode_Desc>
    <CombatMode_Desc>The combat suite is configured to provide a heavily structured learning environment in an urbworld military cadet school. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of combat and combat-related operations such as building defenses, breaching entrenched positions and triage. As more focus is put on certain skills being trained vat occupants have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.</CombatMode_Desc>
    <LaborMode_Desc>The labor suite is configured to provide a heavily structured learning environment on an off-grid agriworld homestead. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of farming, animal husbandry, housekeeping and maker skills. As occupants experience a harder, more work-oriented life they have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.</LaborMode_Desc>
    <LeaderMode_Desc>The leader suite is configured to provide a lightly structured learning environment in a glitterworld private academy. Vat occupants gain more knowledge of the arts, medicine, trading, science and general leadership qualities. As the vat occupant experiences a very high resolution facsimile of life they are able to achieve even higher growth tiers of 5-7. Note that this mode runs at a higher resolution and requires more of the growth vat's available processing power, slowing down the growth of the occupant even further than other enhanced modes. NOTE: as intellectual work is disabled for children under 13 it is recommended to keep vat grown leaders in a vat until they are 18 so that they have any chance at all to study this skill.</LeaderMode_Desc>
    <PlayMode_Desc>The playland suite is configured to provide a completely unstructured environment in an imaginary world. Vat occupants gain very few skills, but enough growth is simulated to achieve the maximum growth tier at each growth moment.</PlayMode_Desc>
