    <!-- Vatgrowth exposure - ticks up while pawn is in a growth vat. Ticks faster with use of overclocked learning suites and vatgrowth drugs. When the pawn is a child the condition is harmless and can be easily reduced by spending time out of the vat to socialize and learn in the real world. An adult with high exposure can develop vatshock when they exit the vat, or randomly for a short time afterwards. -->

        <description>Exposure to accelerated growth in a vat. While this has no direct negative effects in children, extensive time spent in simulated realities and/or under the effect of growth-boosting drugs can cause vatshock when adults leave the vat. Scheduling regular time out of the growth vat for the child to socialize and learn with other real people greatly reduces the risk of vatshock developing.</description>

    <!-- Vatshock is a psychological disorder that randomly causes low mood and greater risk of certain mental breaks when the pawn is affected by flashbacks of vat life and paranoia. The condition's initial severity is linked to vatgrowth exposure severity and lasts indefinitely, but can be cured through two different mechanisms - a low chance of curing itself when the pawn acts on an inspiration, or a very low chance of it curing itself with a sustained high mood over long periods. Both mechanisms' chances are heavily reduced by bad vatshock memories, so the Counsel ability is an important part of managing the condition. Once memories and mood swings are stabilized the chance of the condition self-curing is greatly increased, as well as reducing the chance of breaks occurring. -->

        <description>Post-Vatgrowth Stress Disorder, also know as vatshock, is caused by extensive use of growth vat simulations and/or vat growth drugs.\n\nVatshock is a persistent psychological disorder that causes negative mood swings and paranoia, leading to existential crisis when sufferers are caught in vivid flashbacks of simulated life. Vatshock cannot be cured directly, but counseling the memories that surface reduces their severity and gives sufferers a much better chance of coming to terms with their past and curing themselves. Working on an inspirational project is also a very good way of providing the positive reinforcement needed to cure the condition but is not guaranteed and best used in conjunction with counseling.</description>
