        <label>enhanced growth vat learning</label>
        <description>Upgrades the software of all growth vats to enable better quality skill learning and growth. Enables 'enhanced learning' mode for Growth Vats, which enhances occupant growth and skill outcomes with higher quality simulations, at a cost of slower growth and high power requirements.</description>

        <label>Learning suite - Combat</label>
        <description>Unlocks the combat training suite for growth vats with enhanced learning. The combat training suite is configured to provide a heavily structured learning environment in an urbworld military cadet school. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of combat and combat-related operations such as building defenses, breaching entrenched positions and triage. As more focus is put on certain skills being trained vat occupants have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.</description>

        <label>Learning suite - Labor</label>
        <description>Unlocks the labor training suite for growth vats with enhanced learning. The labor training suite is configured to provide a heavily structured learning environment on an off-grid agriworld homestead. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of farming, animal husbandry, housekeeping and maker skills. As occupants experience a harder, more work-oriented life they have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.</description>

        <label>Learning modes - Leader</label>
        <description>Unlocks the leader training suite for growth vats with enhanced learning. The leadership training suite is configured to provide a lightly structured learning environment in a glitterworld private academy. Vat occupants gain more knowledge of the arts, medicine, trading, science and general leadership qualities. As the vat occupant experiences a very high resolution facsimile of life they are able to achieve even higher growth tiers of 5-7. Note that this mode runs at a higher resolution and requires more of the growth vat's available processing power, slowing down the growth of the occupant even further than other enhanced modes.</description>
