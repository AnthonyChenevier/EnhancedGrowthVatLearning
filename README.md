# Enhanced Growth Vat Learning
A mod that adds features to increase the learning rate of children being grown in growth pods to be nearly as good as growing in the real (Rim)world, and optionally train them in specific skill sets.

### Intro:
Growth Vats are a great idea with the introduction of children in Biotech, but I felt that they were a little lackluster in their implementation. I get that vat grown kids shouldn't be as... well adjusted as their free-range counterparts, but the fact that they never gained growth tiers when that was a major feature of the child growth system bugged me. So a couple of weeks later here we are.
