# Enhanced Growth Vats
Adds a togglable enhanced learning mode to Biotech's growth vats. Enhanced learning requires an expensive research, slows down the growth multiplier and requires much more power, but the quality of growth outcomes and skills gained is vastly improved.

Not enough? Well if you want to focus on soldiers, labourers or leaders then you can unlock those researches and set the growth vat to a specific mode. Each mode will focus on training specific skills, with the downside of lower growth outcomes or longer growth times for leaders.

Also makes the growth gizmo visible for pawns in vats so you can see how they are doing, enhanced mode or not.

### Notes/Compatibility
I had to use a destructive Harmony prefix on the Growth Pod's PodLearning property to prevent some funky stuff. This will cause issues with any other mods that rely on this property, but if they do then the other mod is probably trying to to a similar thing and you only want one of them.
