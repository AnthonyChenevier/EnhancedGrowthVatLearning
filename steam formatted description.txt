A mod that adds features to increase the learning rate of children being grown in growth vats to be nearly as good as growing in the real (Rim)world, and optionally train them in specific skill sets.

[h3]RW unstable branch notice[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
The current [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/294100/view/5940838760383806768]unstable branch[/url] of RW changes a few things that this mod doesn't handle (growth speed sticks at 20x, for one)
As the changes aren't backwards compatible and I don't think RW's version number will change, I'm holding off on releasing my own update on steam until I know more.
If you're on the unstable branch I have an active dev branch on GitHub [url=https://github.com/AnthonyChenevier/EnhancedGrowthVatLearning/tree/dev]Here[/url].
As soon as the changes to RW go live this mod will be updated to match, so if you're not on unstable you have nothing to worry about :)

[h3]Intro[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
Growth Vats are a great idea with the introduction of children in Biotech, but I felt that they were a little lackluster in their implementation. I get that vat grown kids shouldn't be as... well adjusted as their free-range counterparts, but the fact that they never gained growth tiers when that was a major feature of the child growth system bugged me. So I made this:    

[h3]Description[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
Are you sick of maladjusted, unskilled, vat-grown colonists?
Do you have a bunch of energy to throw away now that you can power and pollute to your pleasure?
Well have I got a deal for you - presenting the 'Enhanced Growth Vat Learning Suite'!
Research breakthroughs have led to great strides in the quality and efficiency of neural stimulation, allowing a modification to Growth Vats that provides higher resolution simulations to their occupants than previously possible.
Vat occupants can experience something close to a real life, with all of the growth and learning opportunities that experience brings, at a cost of higher power requirements and slower growing speeds.
Additional training suites can also be researched, allowing for more fine-grained control over the kinds of experiences vat occupants can receive. 

[list]
[*] The default training suite that starts unlocked provides a fairly unstructured learning environment in a common urbworld school. Vat occupants can gain random skills available at their age and enough growth is simulated to achieve growth tier 4-6 at each growth moment.
[*] The combat training suite provides a heavily structured learning environment in an urbworld military cadet school. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of combat and combat-related operations such as building defenses, breaching entrenched positions and triage. As more focus is put on certain skills being trained vat occupants have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.
[*] The labor training suite provides a heavily structured learning environment on an off-grid agriworld homestead. Vat occupants will gain more knowledge of farming, animal husbandry, housekeeping and maker skills. As occupants experience a harder, more work-oriented life they have less personal growth opportunities and can expect to achieve a growth tier of 3-5.
[*] Finally the leadership training suite provides a lightly structured learning environment in a glitterworld private academy. Vat occupants gain more knowledge of the arts, medicine, trading, science and general leadership qualities. As the vat occupant experiences a very high resolution facsimile of life they are able to achieve even higher growth tiers of 5-7. Note that this mode runs at a higher resolution and requires more of the growth vat's available processing power, slowing down the growth of the occupant even further than other enhanced modes. 
[/list]

NOTE: while you can change the environment the occupant experiences, you cannot 100% control how they will respond to growth or what exact skills they will learn. Additionally, children start with many skills locked so skill experience patterns will reflect this. For best result keep teenagers in vats to continue training when all skills are unlocked and passions are generated.

[h3]How it works[/h3]
[hr][/hr]
[olist]
[*] Find or purchase from traders the enhanced growth vat learning techprints (or use my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876747024]Configurable Techprints[/url] mod to remove techprint restrictions).
[*] Unlock the new research project 'Enhanced growth vat learning' (in the Enhanced Vat Learning research tab).
[*] (Optional) Unlock the different learning mode researches. Leader mode requires a further techprint purchase because of it's POWAH.
[*] Make a baby (natural or embryo) and put it in the vat.
[*] Wait for baby to age into a child (a good reason to keep the original 20x speed mode).
[*] Look at the child in the vat - see it's (now visible for all vat children in this mod) growth gizmo? Now you can see how abysmal growth is for vanilla vat kids (2 growth points per day, unadjusted for speed of growth in any way)
[*] Use the gizmos on your growth vats to toggle enhanced mode on or off, and cycle the learning mode if researched (Default, Combat, Labor, Leader).
[*] Go do other stuff until you reach a growth moment for your vat child (unlike vanilla vats, in this mod vat growth is completely paused until you make your growth moment decision, when enhanced mode is enabled)
[*] Repeat last step until the child reaches 13 years old (3 growth moments).
[*] You can now either leave the teenager in the vat to continue learning skills until they are 18 or dump them out early if you need the people.
[*] Profit
